Hello! Welcome to the Morse Code Program!

This simple program allows you to convert text to morse code.
One setting gives you a puzzle in morse code and your job is to figure out what text it stands for.
The goal of this program is to teach myself morse code.

Commit 1: Bulk of code.
Commit 2: Changed file retrieval system.
